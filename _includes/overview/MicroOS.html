    MicroOS offers an offline image. The main difference between the offline and self-install/raw images are that the offline image has an installer. Raw and self-install allows for customization via combustion or manually in the image after it is written to the disk. There is an option for a real-time kernel.

    Try MicroOS in VMs running on either <a href="https://www.suse.com/c/happened-kernel-xen/">Xen</a> or KVM. Using a Raspberry Pi or other System on Chip hardware may use the preconfigured image together with the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Combustion">Combustion</a> functionality for the boot process. Both preconfigured and self-installed images are intended to be used with  <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Combustion">Combustion</a>  written to a USB, which is driven to allow configuration on any first boot, with the option for default password protected changes.
