  Please be aware of the following limitations of the live images:
  * They should not be used to install or upgrade Tumbleweed. Please use the [Tumbleweed media](/tumbleweed) instead
  * They have a limited package and driver selection, so cannot be considered an accurate reflection as to whether Tumbleweed will work on your hardware or not

choosing_media: Choosing Which Media to Download
choosing_media_p1: |
  The DVD/USB Stick is typically recommended as it contains most of the
  packages available in the distribution and does not require a network
  connection during the installation.
choosing_media_p2: |
  The Network CD/USB Stick is recommended for users who have limited
  bandwidth on their internet connections, as it will only download the
  packages they choose to install, which is likely to be significantly
  less than 4.7GB.

verify_download: Verify Your Download Before Use
verify_download_p1: "Many applications can verify the checksum of a download. To verify\n\
  your download can be important as it verifies you really have got the\nISO file\
  \ you wanted to download and not some broken version.\n"
verify_download_p2: |
  For each ISO, we offer a checksum file with the corresponding SHA256 sum.
verify_download_p3: |
  For extra security, you can use GPG to verify who signed those .sha256 files.

desktops: Many desktops, three by default
desktops_p1: |
  The openSUSE contribution process empowers desktop development for
  everybody, so you have the choice to pick your favourite one in the
  installer. We actively feature three desktop environments, and offer
  even more in the expanded software view within the installer.
installation: Install it how you want it
installation_p1: "The openSUSE Installation process provides you with all the options\n\
  you would possibly need. Want to install your system with mouse and\nkeyboard? Load\
  \ up the installer in graphical mode. Don't have a mouse\non hand? Enable the terminal\
  \ client and install it that way. Don't have\nphysical access to the machine? Connect\
  \ to the installer remotely and\nget on with the installation. It's that simple.\n"
points_transparent: Everything is transparent
points_transparent_p1: |
  From start to finish, every package which goes into the distributions
  has all of its sources and build scripts openly visible for everyone
  to see. Doubtful of a source? Just check it out on the build service.
points_free: Free software? Your choice
points_free_p1: |
  Packages in the distributions are divided into free and non-free
  repositories. Don't want to use non-free packages? You can easily
  disable the non-free repository. It's your choice, not ours.
points_welcoming: Welcoming contributions
points_welcoming_p1: |
  We try our best to please the community, and we can only make this
  happen when the community is vocal about what they need. That's why we
  ensure contributing is as easy as possible.
snapper: System got corrupted? Not a problem anymore
snapper_p1: "The Filesystem Snapshots feature keeps your filesystem in check by\n\
  having continuous backups performed automatically when installing\nsoftware and\
  \ updates. Just boot from an earlier snapshot and bring\nyour system to a working\
  \ state in the matter of minutes.\n"
software: Getting software couldn't be easier
software_p1: |
  Between us, having to go through every website to get all the
  software you might need is a lot of work. The online software center
  makes this way easier, by incorporating software from a plethora of
  sources in one place.
software_get: Get Software
transactional: Transactional server
transactional_p1: |
  The installer now supports a new system role Transactional Server,
  which is an outcome of the openSUSE Kubic efforts. This system role
  features a new update system that applies updates atomically (as a
  single operation) and makes them easy to revert should it become
  necessary. These features are based on the package management tools
  that all other SUSE and openSUSE distributions rely on. This means
  that the vast majority of RPM packages that work with other system
  roles of openSUSE distributions also work with the system role
  Transactional Server.
yast: YaST, the best choice for the ~~power~~ user
yast_p1: |
  One of the greatest system configuration tools helps you, the user, to
  setup every single aspect of your system. You no longer need to go
  through a plethora of configuration scripts or enter dubious commands
  to get the system setup as you need it.

zypper: Zypper, your new favourite package manager
zypper_p1: |
  It's quick and easy to learn. Provides zypper-apt, a compatibilty
  layer for usage with apt and apt-get commands. It's based on libsolv,
  which guarantees both speed and reproducable resolving of
  dependencies. The interface is clear and appropriately coloured, for
  ease of reading. It's perfect, what else could be said?
